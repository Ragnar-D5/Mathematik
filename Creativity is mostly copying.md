Few subjects are so misunderstood as creativity. We tend to im-
bue creative individuals with a near-magical aura, but creativity
is much more mundane in practice.
In an impressive review of significant inventions, Matt Ridley ar-
gues that innovation results from an evolutionary process. Rath-
er than springing into the world fully-formed, new invention is
essentially the random mutation of old ideas. When those ideas
prove useful, they expand to fill a new niche.
Evidence for this view comes from the phenomenon of near-si-
multaneous innovations. Numerous times in history, multiple,
unconnected people have developed the same innovation,
which suggests that these inventions were somehow “nearby” in
the space of possibilities right before their discovery.
Even in fine art, the importance of copying has been neglect-
ed. Yes, many revolutions in art were explicit rejections of past
trends. But the revolutionaries themselves were, almost without
exception, steeped in the tradition they rebelled against. Rebel-
ling against any convention requires awareness of that conven-
tion.
