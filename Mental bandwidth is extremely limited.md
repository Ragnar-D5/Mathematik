We can only keep a few things in mind at any one time. George
Miller initially pegged the number at seven, plus or minus two
items. But more recent work has suggested the number is closer
to four things.
This incredibly narrow space is the bottleneck through which all
learning, every idea, memory and experience must flow if it is
going to become a part of our long-term experience. Subliminal
learning doesn’t work. If you aren’t paying attention, you’re not
learning.
The primary way we can be more efficient with learning is to en-
sure the things that flow through the bottleneck are useful. De-
voting bandwidth to irrelevant elements may slow us down.
Since the 1980s, cognitive load theory has been used to explain
how interventions optimize (or limit) learning based on our limit-
ed mental bandwidth. This research finds:
• Problem solving may be counterproductive for beginners.
Novices do better when shown worked examples (solutions)
instead.
• Materials should be designed to avoid needing to flip be-
tween pages or parts of a diagram to understand the material.
• Redundant information impedes learning.
• Complex ideas can be learned more easily when presented
first in parts.
