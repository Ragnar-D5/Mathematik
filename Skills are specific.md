Transfer refers to enhanced abilities in one task after practice or
training in a different task. In research on transfer, a typical pat-
tern shows up:
• Practice at a task makes you better at it.
• Practice at a task helps with similar tasks (usually ones that
overlap in procedures or knowledge).
• Practice at one task helps little with unrelated tasks, even if
they seem to require the same broad abilities like “memory,”
“critical thinking” or “intelligence.”
It’s hard to make exact predictions about transfer because they
depend on knowing both exactly how the human mind works
and the structure of all knowledge. However, in more restricted
domains, John Anderson has found that productions—IF-THEN
rules that operate on knowledge—form a fairly good match for
the amount of transfer observed in intellectual skills.
While skills may be specific, breadth creates generality. For in-
stance, learning a word in a foreign language is only helpful
when using or hearing that word. But if you know many words,
you can say a lot of different things.
Similarly, knowing one idea may matter little, but mastering
many can give enormous power. Every extra year of education
improves IQ by 1-5 points, in part because the breadth of knowl-
edge taught in school overlaps with that needed in real life (and
on intelligence tests).
If you want to be smarter, there are no shortcuts—you’ll have to
learn a lot. But the converse is also true. Learning a lot makes
you more intelligent than you might predict.
