Retrieving knowledge strengthens memory more than seeing
something for a second time does. Testing knowledge isn’t just a
way of measuring what you know—it actively improves your
memory. In fact, testing is one of the best study techniques re-
searchers have discovered.
Why is retrieval so helpful? One way to think of it is that the
brain economizes effort by remembering only those things that
are likely to prove useful. If you always have an answer at hand,
there’s no need to encode it in memory. In contrast, the difficulty
associated with retrieval is a strong signal that you need to re-
member.
Retrieval only works if there is something to retrieve. This is why
we need books, teachers and classes. When memory fails, we
fall back on problem-solving search which, depending on the
size of the problem space, may fail utterly to give us a correct
answer. However, once we’ve seen the answer, we’ll learn more
by retrieving it than by repeatedly viewing it.
