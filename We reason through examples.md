How people can think logically is an age-old puzzle. Since Kant,
we’ve known that logic can’t be acquired from experience.
Somehow, we must already know the rules of logic, or an illogi-
cal mind could never have invented them. But if that is so, why
do we so often fail at the kinds of problems logicians invent?
In 1983, Philip Johnson-Laird proposed a solution: we reason by
constructing a mental model of the situation.
To test a syllogism like “All men are mortal. Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal,” we imagine a collection of men,
all of whom are mortal, and imagine that Socrates is one of
them. We deduce the syllogism is true through this examination.
Johnson-Laird suggested that this mental-model based reason-
ing also explains our logical deficits. We struggle most with log-
ical statements that require us to examine multiple models. The
more models that need constructing and reviewing, the more
likely we will make mistakes.
Related research by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky shows
that this example-based reasoning can lead us to mistake our
fluency in recalling examples for the actual probability of an
event or pattern. For instance, we might think more words fit the
pattern K _ _ _ than _ _ K _ because it is easier to think of exam-
ples in the first category (e.g., KITE, KALE, KILL) than the second
(e.g., TAKE, BIKE, NUKE).
Reasoning through examples has several implications:
1. Learning is often faster through examples than abstract de-
scriptions.
2. To learn a general pattern, we need many examples.
3. We must watch out when making broad inferences based on a
few examples. (Are you sure you’ve considered all the possi-
ble cases?)
