After years spent in school, how many of us could still pass the
final exams we needed to graduate? Faced with classroom ques-
tions, many adults sheepishly admit they recall little.
Forgetting is the unavoidable fate of any skill we don’t use reg-
ularly. Hermann Ebbinghaus found that knowledge tapers off
at an exponential rate—most quickly at the beginning, slowing
down as time elapses.
Yet there is a silver lining. Relearning is usually much faster than
initial learning. Some of this can be understood as a threshold
problem. Imagine memory strength ranges between 0 and 100.
Under some threshold, say 35, a memory is inaccessible. Thus
if a memory dropped from 36 to 34 in strength, you would for-
get what you had known. But even a little boost from relearning
would repair the memory enough to recall it. In contrast a new
memory (starting at zero) would require much more work.
Connectionist models, inspired by human neural networks, offer
another argument for the potency of relearning. In these models,
a computational neural network may take hundreds of iterations
to reach the optimal point. And if you “jiggle” the connections in
this network, it forgets the right answer and responds no better
than if by chance. However, as with the threshold explanation
above, the network relearns the optimal response much faster
the second time.1
Relearning is a nuisance, especially since struggling with previ-
ously easy problems can be discouraging. Yet it’s no reason not
to learn deeply and broadly—even forgotten knowledge can be
revived much faster than starting from scratch.
