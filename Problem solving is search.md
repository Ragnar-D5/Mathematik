Herbert Simon and Allen Newell launched the study of problem
solving with their landmark book, Human Problem Solving. In it,
they argued that people solve problems by searching through a
problem space.
A problem space is like a maze: you know where you are now,
you’d know if you’ve reached the exit, but you don’t know how to
get there. Along the way, you’re constrained in your movements
by the maze’s walls.
Problem spaces can also be abstract. Solving a Rubik’s cube, for
instance, means moving through a large problem space of con-
figurations—the scrambled cube is your start, the cube with each
color segregated to a single side is the exit, and the twists and
turns define the “walls” of the problem space.
Real-life problems are typically more expansive than mazes or
Rubik’s cubes—the start state, end state and exact moves are 
often not clear-cut. But searching through the space of possi-
bilities is still a good characterization of what people do when
solving unfamiliar problems—meaning when they don’t yet have
a method or memory that guides them directly to the answer.
One implication of this model is that, without prior knowledge,
most problems are really difficult to solve. A Rubik’s cube has
over forty-three quintillion configurations—a big space to search
in if you aren’t clever about it. Learning is the process of acquir-
ing patterns and methods to cut down on brute-force searching.
