How much you’re able to learn depends on what you already
know. Research finds that the amount of knowledge retained
from a text depends on prior knowledge of the topic. This effect
can even outweigh general intelligence in some situations.
As you learn new things, you integrate them into what you al-
ready know. This integration provides more hooks for you to re-
call that information later. However, when you know little about
a topic, you have fewer hooks to put new information on. This
makes the information easier to forget. Like a crystal growing
from a seed, future learning is much easier once a foundation is
established.
This process has limits, of course, or knowledge would acceler-
ate indefinitely. Still, it’s good to keep in mind because the early
phases of learning are often the hardest and can give a mislead-
ing impression of future difficulty within a field.
