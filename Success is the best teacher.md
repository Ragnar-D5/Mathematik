We learn more from success than failure. The reason is that prob-
lem spaces are typically large, and most solutions are wrong.
Knowing what works cuts down the possibilities dramatically,
whereas experiencing failure only tells you one specific strategy
doesn’t work.
A good rule is to aim for a roughly 85% success rate when learn-
ing. You can do this by calibrating the difficulty of your practice
(open vs. closed book, with vs. without a tutor, simple vs. com-
plex problems) or by seeking extra training and assistance when
falling below this threshold. If you succeed above this threshold,
you’re probably not seeking hard enough problems—and are
practicing routines instead of learning new skills.
