Skills become increasingly automated through practice. This
reduces our conscious awareness of the skill, making it require
less of our precious working memory capacity to perform. Think
of driving a car: at first, using the blinkers and the brakes was
painfully deliberate. After years of driving, you barely think about
it.
The increased automation of skills has drawbacks, however. One
is that it becomes much harder to teach a skill to someone else.
When knowledge becomes tacit, it becomes harder to make
explicit how you make a decision. Experts frequently underesti-
mate the importance of “basic” skills because, having long been
automated, they don’t seem to factor much into their daily deci-
sion-making.
Another drawback is that automated skills are less open to con-
scious control. This can lead to plateaus in progress when you
keep doing something the way you’ve always done it, even when
that is no longer appropriate. Seeking more difficult challenges
becomes vital because these bump you out of automaticity and
force you to try better solutions.
